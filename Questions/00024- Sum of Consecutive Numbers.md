# Sum of Consecutive Numbers

Math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.

Letâ€™s save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you!

Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).

**Sample Input** </br>
50

**Sample Output** </br>
1275

**Explanation**: The sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 is equal to **1275**

> You can iterate over a range and calculate the sum of all numbers in the range. </br>
Remember, **range(a, b)** does not include b, thus you need to use **b+1** to include b in the range
