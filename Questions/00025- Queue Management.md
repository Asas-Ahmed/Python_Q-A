# Queue Management

You are working on a **queue management** program. </br>
The queue is represented by a list. </br>
Write a program to take an input, add it to the end of the queue, and output the resulting list.

```python
queue = ['John', 'Rob', 'David', 'Wilson']
```

> The **append()** method can be used to add new items to the list
