# Leaderboard

You need to make a program for a leaderboard.
The program needs to output the numbers 1 to 10, each on a separate line, followed by a dot: </br>
**1. </br>
2. </br>
3. </br>
...**

> You can use the **\n** newline character to create line breaks, or, alternatively, create the desired output using three double quotes **"""**
