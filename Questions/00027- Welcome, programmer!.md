# Welcome, programmer!

We have a function that outputs "Welcome, user" as it is called. We want to make it more personalized, so redesign the given function so that it will take the name of the user as input and output the welcome message with it.

```python
print("Welcome, user")
```

**Sample Input** </br>
Tommy

**Sample Output** </br>
Welcome, Tommy

> Don't forget to **indent** the statement in the function
